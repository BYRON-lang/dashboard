# ✅ Firebase Configuration - Now Using Firestore Database

The application now uses **Firebase Firestore** (database) to store website information as structured documents instead of JSON files in Storage.

## 🔧 **Current Implementation**

### **Database Storage (Firestore)**
- ✅ Website data stored as **Firestore documents** in `websites` collection
- ✅ Each website has a unique document ID
- ✅ Supports real-time queries and updates
- ✅ Better for structured data like website metadata

### **File Storage (Storage)**
- 🎥 Video files still stored in **Firebase Storage** in `videos/` folder
- 🎥 Videos are uploaded separately and linked via URL in database

## 📊 **Data Structure**

**Firestore Document** (`websites/{id}`):
```json
{
  "id": "unique-document-id",
  "name": "Website Name",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "categories": ["portfolio", "react"],
  "socialLinks": {
    "twitter": "username",
    "instagram": "username"
  },
  "builtWith": ["React", "Next.js"],
  "otherTechnologies": "Tailwind CSS, TypeScript",
  "videoUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/...",
  "uploadedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

After setting up Firebase config, open your browser's developer console and try saving a website again. You should see detailed logs showing:

- ✅ Firebase configuration status
- ✅ Firestore document creation
- ✅ Success/failure messages
- ✅ Document retrieval from `websites` collection

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the form** - Try saving a website now
2. **Check Firebase Console** - Go to **Firestore Database** → **Data** tab
3. **Verify data** - You should see documents in the `websites` collection
4. **Check videos** - Uploaded videos appear in **Storage** → **Files** tab

The website information is now properly stored in Firebase Firestore database! 🎉
